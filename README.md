# Web-Design-Challenge

I did not create the folder Webvisualizations as the ReadMe from homework suggests.

Both index.html and 00_LandingPage are the same. After creating all the htmls I realized I really needed ot have a index.html so that it would be the base for my deployed app.

For this requirement "The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).", when I resize my Chrome window it changes the color as requested. However, when I use the Inspect and Toggle Device toolbar icon, it does not really work. I do not understand where the difference is coming. I tried to google it, but found people with the same problem and not really a good solution. I am happy to learn where the problem may be, if you know that.
